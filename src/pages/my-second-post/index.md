I am blind, <br>
To all I do not wish to see. <br>
But what transcends beyond this veil of sight, <br>
Becomes everything I'll never be. <br>
<br>
Humbling, <br>
Knowing for certain what I cannot, <br>
And will not ever achieve. <br>
It only costs a pittance in self worth, <br>
Without the heart ever wanting free. <br>
<br>
The deeper, the darker, the lower I descend; <br>
The more acclimated, de-humanized I become, <br>
As I see strangers wearing faces of people I once considered friends. <br>
<br>
Vision blurs,<br>
It's more than most can take...<br>
...it's more than most can give.<br>
A crack becomes a hole, as touch becomes but dreams.<br>
Senses failing,<br>
Reality fades into a haze of definitions,<br>
<br>
Undefining things.<br>
<br>
I am a casualty of thought,<br>
I am but helpless at its hand.<br>
For what vanity assumes in beauty,<br>
I only see in trends.<br>
<br>
They tell me I am not alone,<br>
Yet I'm dying in between;<br>
<br>
Two worlds beyond this mirror,<br>
Both ripping at their seams.<br>
<br>
So as darkness assumes all,<br>
As there's nowhere left to run.<br>
I scribble the word 'alone' in dirt.<br>
<br>
Because it always end in one.
